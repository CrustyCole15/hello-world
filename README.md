First Repository
I go to college and am currently finishing up my Associates in Game Design and Development at Joliet Junior College. I will be transferring to Depaul University once I do complete my degree to pursue a degree in software engineering. 
I currently know how to code in QBASIC and have some experience with coding in Linux. I am studying C right now in classes, and I am learning HTML and Javascript through Free Code Camp on my own time.
